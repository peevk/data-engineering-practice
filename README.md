##Data Engineering Practice Problems

One of the main obstacles of Data Engineering is the large
and varied technical skills that can be required on a 
day-to-day basis.


This aim of this repository is to help you develop and 
learn those skills. Generally, here are the high level
topics that these practice problems will cover.

- Python data processing.
- csv, flat-file, parquet, json, etc.
- SQL database table design.
- Python + Postgres, data ingestion and retrieval.
- PySpark
- Data cleansing / dirty data.

### How to work on the problems.
You will need two things to work effectively on most all
of these problems. 
- `Docker`
- `docker-compose`

All the tools and technologies you need will be packaged
  into the `dockerfile` for each exercise.

For each exercise you will need to `cd` into that folder and
run the `docker build` command, that command will be listed in
the `README` for each exercise, follow those instructions.

### Exercises

#### 1. Downloading files.
The first exercise tests your ability to download a number of files
from an `HTTP` source and unzip them, storing them locally with `Python`.
`cd Exercises/Exercise-1` and see `README` located their for instructions.
